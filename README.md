# SideNode

### Guide creation date: 03.04.2024

### Update date: 04/19/2024

### Project Description:

*Side protocol* is a full-stack omnichannel exchange infrastructure offering specialized infrastructure, tools and applications for DeFi asset exchange. They focus on 4 principles. Scalability, interoperability, decentralization and exchange.

The solution they offer is designed to address CEX - centralization, DEX - problem with integrating new tokens, DEX - limited user experience compared to CEX. DEX is very demanding in terms of scalability and performance, in such cases gas fees are very high, which hits small traders. Here are the main problems Side Protocol wants to solve

**Investment:** 

I can single out Eric Chen, who is the CEO of Injective. After all, the product is very similar to Injective and will probably complement/combine it. As CEO Shane said, there will be a $30M closed tokensale and this amount will attract many people to the project.
